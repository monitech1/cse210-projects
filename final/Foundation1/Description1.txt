Description of Foundation 1 program

"In creating the YouTube video program, I made things simpler by using a principle called abstraction.
 I used two main classes, Video and Comment, to keep things focused on the most important details. 
 The Video class represents a video in a basic way, highlighting things like the title, author, and length.
  Likewise, the Comment class takes care of comment details, like the commenter's name and what they wrote. 
  This made the code easier to handle and understand, making it better overall. 
  It's now easier to maintain and read, and it highlights the important parts of how the program works.
